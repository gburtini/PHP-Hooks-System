PHP Hooks and Filters System
============================

_Event-driven programming, a plugin architecture, hooks, filters, all wrapped in to a simple, efficient and clean Composer-ready interface._

This is an elegant way of coding plugin architectures or other decoupled software solutions. The class provides three major methods: bind, run and filter; combined, these allow you to integrate in to existing systems without interfering with their existing code.

Installation
------------

Everything you need is contained within the single file ``hooks.php``, but the most convenient way to install is with composer:

    composer require gburtini/hooks
    
    

Usage
-----
* ``bind(string $hook, callback $callback, int $priority)`` - binds a callback to a hook
* ``run(string $hook, array $parameters)`` - executes all the functions bound to a given hook
* ``filter(string $hook, object $value, array $parameters)`` - executes all the functions bound to a given hook, passing in $value each time, and finally return the value

The designed use case is that throughout your existing software, you will call ``Hooks::filter`` and ``Hooks::run`` where you want to allow users to hook with a specified ``$hook`` value. Then users can call ``Hooks::bind()`` anytime before your code runs to associate code with the various locations -- filters will return the value (so that a function can change it) and run calls will simply run functions with no in-code side effects.

Future Work
-----------

A nice future feature would be to enforce some sort of constraints on what these binds can do -- allowing "untrusted" (in the sense of the data) code to run in some sort of quasi-sandbox; for example, the filters could check to ensure the value was constrained to a particular type, range or callback validation.

Sorting can be called less frequently. If nothing has changed, it is unnecessary to call the sort function again. That said, the used quicksort variant should be rapid on already sorted data.
