PHP Hook / Filter System - a class for binding events to actions.

This is an elegant way of coding plugin architectures or other decoupled software solutions. The class provides three major methods: bind, run and filter; combined, these allow you to integrate in to existing systems without interfering with their existing code.

                 * bind(string $hook, callback $callback, int $priority) - binds a callback to a hook
                 * run(string $hook, array $parameters) - executes all the functions bound to a given hook
                 * filter(string $hook, object $value, array $parameters) - executes all the functions bound to a given hook, passing in $value each time, and finally return the value

The designed use case is that throughout your existing software, you will call Hooks::filter and Hooks::run where you want to allow users to hook with a specified $hook value. Then users can call Hooks::bind() anytime before your code runs to associate code with the various locations -- filters will return the value (so that a function can change it) and run calls will simply run functions with no in-code side effects.

A nice future feature would be to enforce some sort of constraints on what these binds can do -- allowing untrusted code to run in some sort of quasi-sandbox; for example, the filters could check to ensure the value stayed integral or stayed matching a particular regular expression.
